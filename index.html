                    <p class="col-lg-9">My name is Arshia. I live in Newport Beach with my beautiful wife and 7-month-old baby daughter. I am a Southern
                        California native, born and raised. Being from So-Cal obviously means I am a huge Laker’s fan. I love
                        all things technology, currently I am learning how to code. Presently I am working at an aerospace manufacturing
                        company, located in Long Beach, as the IT Manager. I really enjoy travelling whenever I can, my favorite
                        destination was Thailand. My wife and I visited in 2014 where I proposed, got to see the most beautiful
                        islands, and got bit by monkey. It was a very memorable trip. This is my first full coding project that
                        involves HTML and CSS. My coding journey only began a month ago, but I am really enjoying the challenge
                        every day. More coding experience coming soon, thanks for visiting.
