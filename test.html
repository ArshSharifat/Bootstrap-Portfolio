                            destination was Thailand. My wife and I visited in 2014 where I proposed, got to see the most
                            beautiful islands, and got bit by monkey. It was a very memorable trip. This is my first full
                            coding project that involves HTML and CSS. My coding journey only began a month ago, but I am
                            really enjoying the challenge every day. More coding experience coming soon, thanks for visiting.
